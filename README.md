# Data-Science-Projects
Welcome to my open-access GitHub repository.

Here I have collected the healthcare-related projects that I completed during my Masters in Data Science program at the University of Virginia between Summer 2021 and Spring 2022.

A special thanks to all of the teammates that I worked with and learned from!
